  Modular Structure Created:

  📁 Directory Structure:
  - src/types/ - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - src/constants/ - Mock data and configuration
  - src/utils/ - Pure utility functions (metrics, export, evaluation)
  - src/hooks/ - Custom React hooks for state management
  - src/components/ - Reusable UI components

  🔧 Key Improvements:

  1. Separated Concerns: Logic split into focused modules
  2. Custom Hooks: State management logic extracted into reusable hooks
  3. TypeScript Types: Proper type definitions for better code safety
  4. Component Isolation: Each UI section is now a separate component
  5. Utility Functions: Pure functions extracted for reusability

  ✅ Build Status:
  - TypeScript compilation successful
  - Vite build successful (541KB bundle)
  - Development server runs on localhost:5173

  📂 Final Structure:
  src/
  ├── CausalExtractionFramework.tsx (Main orchestrator)
  ├── types/index.ts (All interfaces)
  ├── constants/index.ts (Mock data, prompts)
  ├── utils/
  │   ├── metrics.ts (Evaluation calculations)
  │   ├── export.ts (JSON/CSV export)
  │   └── evaluation.ts (Mock prediction logic)

      ├── ResultsTab.tsx
      ├── DatabaseTab.tsx

  The application is now properly modularized with clear separation of concerns, making it maintainable and
  following React best practices.

  🔄 How It All Works Together

  1. index.html loads in browser
  2. main.tsx starts the React app
  3. CausalExtractionFramework.tsx renders the main interface
  4. Components use hooks for state management
  5. Utils handle calculations and data processing
  6. Types ensure everything works together correctly

  This modular structure makes the code maintainable, testable,
  and reusable - key principles in professional React development!

> Now do the same for all files outside of the given structure in 
  this project apart from Claude.md and LAST_INFO.txt

● I'll examine the other files in your project that aren't part of
   the main modular structure. Let me check what these files
  contain:

● Read(ceev_v10.tsx.backup)
  ⎿  Read 832 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(test-modular.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can explain all the additional files in your
  project:

  📋 Additional Files Outside Main Structure

  ceev_v10.tsx.backup (832 lines)

  - What it is: The original monolithic version of your
  application
  - What it does:
    - Contains the ENTIRE application in one massive file (before
  modularization)
    - Serves as a backup/reference of the original code
    - Shows how the app worked when everything was in a single
  component
  - Why it's important:
    - Safety net - if the modular version breaks, you can
  reference this
    - Historical record of the refactoring process
    - Contains all the original logic that was split into separate
   modules

  test-modular.tsx (5 lines)

  - What it is: Simple test wrapper component
  - What it does:
    - Imports and renders the new modular
  CausalExtractionFramework
    - Acts as a minimal test harness
    - Allows testing the modular version separately
  - Why it exists:
    - Quick way to test if the modularization worked correctly
    - Minimal entry point for debugging

  node_modules/ (Directory)

  - What it is: External dependencies storage
  - What it does:
    - Contains all the downloaded npm packages (React, TypeScript,
   etc.)
    - Automatically managed by npm/yarn
    - Never edit this manually - it's regenerated when you run npm
   install

  dist/ (Directory)

  - What it is: Built/compiled output directory
  - What it does:
    - Contains the final JavaScript files after building
    - Generated when you run npm run build
    - These are the files that would be deployed to a web server
    - Never edit this manually - it's generated automatically

  package-lock.json (Auto-generated)

  - What it is: Exact dependency version lock file
  - What it does:
    - Records the EXACT versions of every package and
  sub-dependency
    - Ensures everyone gets identical installations
    - Automatically generated/updated by npm
    - Never edit this manually

  🔍 What This Tells Us About Your Project Evolution

  Before Modularization (ceev_v10.tsx.backup):

  One Giant File (832 lines)
  ├── All components inline
  ├── All logic mixed together
  ├── Hard to maintain
  └── Difficult to test individual parts

  After Modularization (current structure):

  Organized Structure
  ├── src/CausalExtractionFramework.tsx (orchestrator)
  ├── src/components/ (UI pieces)
  ├── src/hooks/ (state logic)
  ├── src/utils/ (calculations)
  └── src/types/ (data contracts)

  🎯 Key Differences You Should Understand

  Old Approach (ceev_v10.tsx.backup):

  - Everything in one file: Components, logic, data, calculations
  all mixed
  - Hard to debug: If something breaks, you have to search through
   800+ lines
  - Difficult to test: Can't test individual pieces in isolation
  - Code reuse impossible: Logic is embedded in components

  New Approach (current modular structure):

  - Separation of concerns: Each file has ONE responsibility
  - Easy to debug: Problem in metrics? Check utils/metrics.ts
  - Testable: Each hook/utility can be tested independently
  - Reusable: Hooks can be used in multiple components

  🚀 Benefits for You as a Beginner

  1. Learning: Each file teaches one concept (hooks, components,
  utilities)
  2. Debugging: Errors point to specific files/functions
  3. Growth: You can modify one piece without breaking others
  4. Best Practices: Follows professional React patterns

   Summary

  I have successfully implemented the JSON output format feature with all requested functionality:

  ✅ Added JSON Output Format Checkbox
  - Located in the Prompt Selection section of the Setup tab
  - Checkbox is checked by default
  - Includes explanatory text "(Instructs models to return structured JSON responses)"

  ✅ State Management
  - Added jsonOutputFormat state to CausalExtractionFramework.tsx (defaults to true)
  - Properly passed through component hierarchy to SetupTab

  ✅ Evaluation Logic Updates
  - Modified useEvaluation hook to accept jsonOutputFormat parameter
  - When enabled, appends JSON format instructions to prompts before LLM calls
  - Entity extraction gets specific JSON instructions: "Response Format (strict JSON): Return a JSON object with a single key
  "entities" whose value is an array of the extracted entity strings. Do not output any other text or explanation."
  - Relationship extraction includes TODO comment for future implementation

  ✅ Enhanced Results Display
  - Updated ResultDetailsModal with improved configuration section
  - Two-column layout showing both prompt template AND output format
  - Output format displayed as color-coded badge (JSON in blue, Plain Text in gray)

  ✅ Type Safety
  - Added outputFormat field to EvaluationResult interface
  - Results now store whether JSON or plain text format was used

  The implementation is backward compatible and integrates seamlessly with the existing evaluation pipeline. The JSON format
  preference is stored with each evaluation result for reference in the detailed results view.
